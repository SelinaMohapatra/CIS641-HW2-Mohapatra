# Overview

The purpose of the Software Requirement Specification is to define assumptions and requirements for the product. The goal is to provide a high level of understanding of the System "The Cook Book", a modern recipe-sharing website, which aims to provide users with a variety of food recipes and be the starting point of development. 

# Software Requirements

This section provides a comprehensive understanding of the systemâ€™s underlying features and functionalities i.e what the system can do and the non-functional requirements which gives an insight into the system behavior and ensures the usability and effectiveness of the system. As it provides a high level of understanding of the application it is useful for developers to implement the system, testers to test the functionality, and end users and admins who would be using the application.

# Change Management Plan

A change management plan is a document used to offer a detailed, step-by-step strategy for adopting change. The purpose of the change management plan is to help manage the change process and also ensure control of the budget, schedule, scope, communication, and resources. The change management plan will minimize the impact a change can have on the application and the stakeholders involved thus reducing the risk and resistance while improving communication and long-term adoption of the new system or process.
