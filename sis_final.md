# Overview

The purpose of the Software Requirement Specification is to define assumptions and requirements for the product. The goal is to provide a high level of understanding of the System "The Cook Book", a modern recipe-sharing website, which aims to provide users with a variety of food recipes and be the starting point of development.

# Change Management Plan:

This section will describe a change management plan for ShareRide application. It will focus on training users, platform availability, performance and issue handling process.


## Why Shareride App?
ShareRide is a cross-platform mobile application for Grand Valley State
University, where all students and faculty members can join and share rides. Any
member of our application can ask for a ride by simply posting a plan, and whichever
member who has a vehicle can pick up the member who asked for a ride. Alternatively,
any member who already owns a vehicle can post his/her plan to visit somewhere, and
whoever fits the schedule can join the trip in first-come-first-serve basis.
## Training Strategy:
We will train people/students by proposing this system to the students during
Students orientation which happens at the start of every new semester and help them
login to the platform using their GVSU email. Like Uber, the first ride will have some
offers. The information about the application will be promoted in the form of posters all
over the campus where the QR code of the app will be provided in the posters.
## Integration within GVSU ecosystem:
The ShareRide application will be integrated on myBanner website, a GVSU
official portal. Since the application is designed for GVSUâ€™s students, it would be
available to them on their official website. Students can get to know about the application
and download the application with the QR code in myBanner.
## Performance Issue and Monitoring:
We will continuously monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and fix bugs. The application follows CI/CD pipeline, deployed on AWS CodePipeline which tests the code
before deploying.
## Availability of the Mobile Application:
The application will be available in both commanly used operating system - Android and iOS.
